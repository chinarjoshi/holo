* Planning
There are a few ways to implement the image proccessing

** AutoCad PNGOUT
_See how fast autocad can output 4 images of the same obj file ong_

Now we don't need a raspberry pi or arduino, instead everything will be done from the host computer.

The webcam will be utilized from the host computer, and controls will be given from the keyboard.
Press G to enable gesture control for the laptop, V to start visualization, < to decrease size and > to increase size.

Fitting the model to be flat on the bottom would be a bit difficult to calculate though

Factors at play:
 - Cost
 - Durability
 - Feature-rich
 - Functionality

For live cadding, we have to either:
 1. Take 4 rotated screenshots at a time.
 2. Split pane view with 1 screenshot and opencv processing.

    switch to tinkerkcad and get rid of the background.
